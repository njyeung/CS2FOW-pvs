# CS2FOW Debug Viewer

Local-only viewer for CS2FOW visibility sampling. It renders exported CS2 player models as reference, then overlays the collision box, sample points, prediction envelope, 160 visibility segments, and optional `.bvh8` blocking.

Valve model exports are local assets. Do not commit them.

## Export Local Models

```powershell
python tools/debug_viewer/export_assets.py --game "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo"
```

This writes ignored files under:

```text
tools/debug_viewer/local_assets/
```

## Run

```powershell
cd tools/debug_viewer
python -m http.server 8765
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/viewer.html
```

Use the BVH8 file picker to load a bake such as:

```text
data/maps/de_mirage.bvh8
```

The viewer uses the current CS2FOW constants: `200ms + ping * 2`, `500ms` cap, `96u` peek margin, `16u` target inflation, `24u` observer shoulder offset from yaw, and `24u` vertical observer offset.
